- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

### Contenets
- 1.2practice-task folder (5 screenshots of the practice tasks)

### why I chose the data structure
#### Task1. recipe_1
I chose dictionary structure because it allows us to store values and objects indexed by identifiers or keys internally.
#### Task3. all_recipes
I chose the list structure so that I can modify or delete the elements stored inside later.
